        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

        <p>My name is Roberto Martinez, Im 22 years old, Hispanic, and a Big basketball fan! So far i've worked in three different places,
            I've worked with Adidas, MillerLite, and Seneca Foods. My biggest position job was at Seneca Foods as an HR clerk, and i was there for 5 months.
            A fun Fact, My favorite basketball player is Stephen Curry because he's proof that no matter who you are and what people think of you anything you work for is yours.

        <h2>RESUME</h2>
        <p>I have 3 years of retail experience with Adidas from september 2020 untill current date, mostly doing customer service, and processing shipment. I worked at Seneca foods from
            June 2023 until October 2023 In Wisconsin. I was employed as an HR clerk mostly doing safety orientations and processing the new hires 
            procedures like orientation videos and paperwork needed. I also made sure the employees were okay and if they needed medical attention
            i would tend to them in the infirmary. Other tasks includ giving out paychecks, handing out necessary safety equipment, taking care of any conflict 
            in the workplace by writing down statements from both sides and reporting it to my boss.
